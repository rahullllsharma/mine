# `@urbint/silica`

Urbint's React component library.

## Installation

`@urbint/silica` is published privately to github, which means you'll need to
[setup your Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with the
`repo` and `read:packages` scope in order to access it.

#### !!! Important !!!

You may face some authorization issues `403 Forbidden` while trying to install the package as a dependency,
so you need to make sure your token is `authorized` before completing the setup.

Go to [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and click on `Configure SSO`
on your created token and a dialog will pop-up with title `Single sign-on organizations`.
Make sure in the bottom of this dialog you have `Urbint - Deauthorize`.
If you have `Urbint - Authorize`, you have to click on `Authorize` and you're good to go.

---

Next, configure your package manager:

<details>
  <summary>npm / yarn</summary>

## Login to `npm.pkg.github.com`

```sh
npm login --scope=@urbint --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

- Username: `<USERNAME>`
- Password: `<PERSONAL-ACCESS-TOKEN>`
- Email: `<PUBLIC-EMAIL-ADDRESS>`

## Configure your project

Then, add a `.npmrc` to your project root:

```
@urbint:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

## Usage

First you'll need to import some css. You might want to do this in your app's
index file or as an import in one of your other css files, depending on how your
project is configured.

```css
/* As a CSS import */
@import "@urbint/silica/dist/index.css";
```

```ts
// As a JavaScript / TypeScript import
import "@urbint/silica/dist/index.css";
```

Once this is done, use the library as you would any other. For example:

```tsx
import { Icon } from "@urbint/silica";
import { FC } from "react";

export const MyCoolButton: FC = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <button>
      {children} <Icon name="chevron_big_down" />
    </button>
  );
};
```

Additionally, there is a tailwind-preset available that you can include in the tailwind-config.js in your app. This allows you to use the default tailwind configurations

```js
/*
/*Load the preset in the config*/
module.exports = {
  purge: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  presets: [require("@urbint/silica/tailwind-preset")],
  plugins: [],
};
```
